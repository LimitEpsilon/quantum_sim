# Quantum simulations for parametric down conversion

Simulations written in python, using the library [QuTiP](https://github.com/qutip/qutip).
The equation for time evolution of a photon under parametric down conversion was adapted from [arXiv:1608.05005](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.05005.pdf).
Code for plotting the average photon number and variances were adapted from [qutip-lectures](https://nbviewer.org/github/jrjohansson/qutip-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-5-Parametric-Amplifier.ipynb).

## Dependencies

matplotlib, scipy, numpy, qutip
